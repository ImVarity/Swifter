# What it does
Swifter connects you to the people you need. People from emergency providers to your closest friends are only one call away.
With the use of AWS Bedrock, an LLM can listen or analyze a situation and decide the severity level of that situation.
Then, it will decide the best course of action whether it be to immediately call 911, contact family members, or turn on
the cameras in your house, the possibilities for help are endless as long as these technologies are interconnected. 

# Tech stack
Next.js, CSS Tailwind, and TypeScript React hooks for interactivity.
With the help of T-Mobile and Nokia's tools we were able to use
Nokia's Network with Code to location's of devices which assisted
in tracking user's phone during a possible emergency.
AWS Bedrock for AI services.
SMS messaging with Vonage.

# Future implementations
We still have a long way to go working to broaden the scope of our project. 
We envision connecting to home/external technologies in order to support the user in better ways.
Simplifying the need to get help when needed is what we aimed to do and utilizing our advanced
tools and technologies in today's world will make your lives easier and safer.
